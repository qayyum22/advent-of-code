To achieve the design shown in the mockup footer using CSS, you can apply the following styles to the HTML structure provided:

```css
#footerWrapper {
    background-color: #d32f2f; /* Red background for the left section */
    color: white;
    padding: 20px 0;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
    position: relative;
}

.footer-content {
    display: flex;
    width: 100%;
    justify-content: space-between;
    padding: 0 20px;
}

.contact-info {
    margin-right: 20px;
}

.org-link-div {
    background-color: #5e35b1; /* Dark purple background for the right section */
    padding: 10px 20px;
    position: absolute;
    right: 0;
    top: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
}

.org-link {
    color: white;
    text-decoration: none;
}

/* Adding a white diagonal stripe for decoration */
#footerWrapper::before {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    left: 60%; /* Adjust this to move the stripe left or right */
    top: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    width: 40px; /* Adjust width as needed */
    background: white;
    transform: skew(15deg); /* Adjust skew to change angle */
    z-index: 1;
}
```

This CSS does the following:

- Sets the main footer (`#footerWrapper`) to have a red background, white text, and uses flexbox for layout.
- The `.footer-content` is styled to distribute space between its children, ensuring the contact info and the org link are spaced out.
- The `.contact-info` elements are given some right margin to space them out from each other.
- The `.org-link-div` is given a dark purple background, positioned absolutely on the right, and its height is set to match its parent's height.
- The `.org-link` is styled to remove the underline and set the color to white.
- A pseudo-element (`::before`) is used on `#footerWrapper` to create a white diagonal stripe for visual interest. Adjust the `left` property to move it horizontally and `transform` for the angle.

This should give you a footer that closely matches the design in your mockup, with the diagonal separator and the color scheme as depicted. Adjust the values as needed for exact positioning and sizes.






To achieve the design shown in the mockup footer with the provided HTML structure, you can use the following CSS:

```css
#footerWrapper {
    background-color: #d32f2f; /* Red background */
    color: white; /* White text color */
    padding: 10px 0; /* Padding for the footer */
    text-align: center; /* Center align the text */
}

.footer-content {
    display: flex; /* Use flexbox for layout */
    justify-content: center; /* Center the content horizontally */
    align-items: center; /* Center the content vertically */
}

.contact-info {
    margin: 0 15px; /* Spacing between contact info items */
    font-size: 16px; /* Font size for contact info */
}

.org-link-div {
    background-color: #5e35b1; /* Purple background for the link section */
    padding: 10px 20px; /* Padding for the link section */
    margin-left: 20px; /* Space between the last contact info and the link */
    border-top-left-radius: 10px; /* Rounded top left corner */
    border-bottom-left-radius: 10px; /* Rounded bottom left corner */
}

.org-link {
    color: white; /* White text color for the link */
    text-decoration: none; /* Remove underline from the link */
    font-size: 16px; /* Font size for the link */
}

/* Pseudo-element for the white triangle */
.org-link-div::before {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    left: -20px; /* Position the triangle to the left of the link section */
    top: 0;
    width: 0;
    height: 0;
    border-top: 30px solid transparent; /* Adjust height to match the link section height */
    border-bottom: 30px solid transparent; /* Adjust height to match the link section height */
    border-right: 20px solid #5e35b1; /* Purple border to create the triangle */
}
```

This CSS will style the footer to match the design in the mockup:

- The footer has a red background with white text.
- The contact information is centered and spaced evenly.
- The link section has a purple background with a white triangle on the left side to create the angled effect.
- The link text is white and without underline.

Make sure to adjust the `padding`, `margin`, and `font-size` values as needed to fit your specific design requirements.







Certainly! To run a similar simulation for a population of 337,107,632 people, you can modify the `num_of_simulations` variable in the Python script to match this number. Here is the updated script:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import random

num_of_simulations = 337_107_632
trump_wins = 0
kamala_wins = 0

for _ in range(num_of_simulations):
    if random.randint(0, 1) == 0:
        trump_wins += 1
    else:
        kamala_wins += 1

print(f"{num_of_simulations:,} simulations were run.")
print(f"Trump wins {trump_wins:,} times")
print(f"Kamala wins {kamala_wins:,} times")

trump_pct = (trump_wins / num_of_simulations) * 100
kamala_pct = 100 - trump_pct

if trump_pct == kamala_pct:
    print("Result: It's a tie, wtf?")
elif trump_pct > 50:
    print(f"Result: Trump wins - probability: {trump_pct:.3f}%")
else:
    print(f"Result: Kamala wins - probability: {kamala_pct:.3f}%")
```

You can run this script in your terminal by saving it to a file (e.g., `run_simulation.py`) and then executing it with Python:

```bash
python run_simulation.py
```

This will simulate the election for 337,107,632 people and output the results. Note that running this simulation with such a large number of iterations will take a considerable amount of time and computational resources. If you want to test it with a smaller subset, you can adjust the `num_of_simulations` to a smaller number and then extrapolate the results.






Sure, I can help you modify the simulation to account for a population of 337,107,632 people. Here's how you can adjust the Python script:

1. **Update the number of simulations**: Since the population is quite large, you might want to run more simulations to get a more accurate result. Let's set the number of simulations to match the population size.

2. **Initialize variables**: Keep track of wins for each candidate.

3. **Run the simulation**: For each person in the population, simulate their vote.

4. **Calculate and print the results**: Compute the percentage of wins and print the results.

Here's the updated script:

```python
import random

num_of_simulations = 337_107_632
trump_wins = 0
kamala_wins = 0

for _ in range(num_of_simulations):
    if random.random() < 0.5:  # Assuming a 50/50 chance for simplicity
        trump_wins += 1
    else:
        kamala_wins += 1

print(f"{num_of_simulations} simulations were run.")
print(f"Trump wins {trump_wins} times")
print(f"Kamala wins {kamala_wins} times")

trump_pct = (trump_wins / num_of_simulations) * 100
kamala_pct = 100 - trump_pct

if trump_pct == kamala_pct:
    print("Result: It's a tie, wtf?")
elif trump_pct > 50:
    print(f"Result: Trump wins - probability: {trump_pct:.3f}%")
else:
    print(f"Result: Kamala wins - probability: {kamala_pct:.3f}%")
```

To run this script:

1. Save the script to a file, for example, `run_simulation_population.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved.
4. Run the script using Python:

```sh
python run_simulation_population.py
```

This script assumes that each person in the population has an equal chance of voting for either candidate. You can adjust the probability in the `random.random()` condition if you have specific probabilities for each candidate.
